//Made a function for resuts as awll as a variable for results, so that it can display the results once all the questions have been answered, to determine the probability of whether you have allergies, or a cold. I can not find out how to get results that calculate the percentage, however it only shows the probablitiy of having a cold or allergies (for ex prob for cold=2 and prob for allergy= 4)

//I used the "w3schools" website and used the HTML Images Syntax, and used the code <img> src="url" and plugged in the photo url into the spot where it says url. the img tag is what shows up the img, and the src attribute specifies the URL web address for the image. -->
